Route 53 Student Notes ::

1. Explain them in details about the website & how they are resolving the names in "www"
2. Teach them about the DNS servers & domain service providers
3. Explain them about the records A,AAAA,CNAME,NS,Alias,TXT etc .. 
4. Register the domain in the route53, show them new domain registration 
5. Explain about the private hosted zone with server example
Note: Make sure you are enabling enableDnsSupport & enableDnsHostnames Other wise dns will not work

commandline ::
Get Details ::

root@DESKTOP-IOC981H:~# aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5 --attribute enableDnsSupport
{
    "VpcId": "vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5",
    "EnableDnsSupport": {
        "Value": true
    }
}
root@DESKTOP-IOC981H:~# aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5 --attribute enableDnsHostnames
{
    "VpcId": "vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5",
    "EnableDnsHostnames": {
        "Value": true
    }
}

enable ::

aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5 --enable-dns-hostnames "{\"Value\":true}"
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-02a7a3de132789ab5 --enable-dns-support "{\"Value\":true}"

6. Explain in detail about public hosted zone with apache configuration.

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from N.Virginia" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

7. Explain about Health check configuration with index.html
Note: Make sure you are configuring the health check for "*.shaans.in" site & show them the
use case of it. 

8. S3 Static webhosting using proper domain 

{
  "Id": "Policy1580494004110",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1580494002926",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*Object"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::failover.devopsarmy.com/*",
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Note: Make sure that you are creating the bucketname with the same name as your domain address 
ex: mys3sitedvs.shaans.in

9. Explain about the Policies

1. Simple :

Routing policies within Route 53 define how the product handles incoming queries. The default type is simple, 
which allows the creation of a single record with a given name (e.g., www). For this record, one or more values 
can be provided â€” in the case of an A record, one or more IPv4 addresses.

Example ::

take 3 servers & show the configuration with public zone & Hostinger configuration (add multiple entries for same name)
bringdown one server & show them the difference.

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
sed -i "88s/Test Page/$(ec2-metadata -p|awk '{print $2}')/" /usr/share/httpd/noindex/index.html
systemctl restart httpd


2. Routing Policy: Failover

Failover routing policies are used in conjunction with Route 53 health checks to provide failover between a primary 
record and a secondary record.

N.Virginia Server ::

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from N.Virginia" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

Ohio Server :

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from Ohio" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd


3. Routing Policy: Weighted

Weighted routing policies allow granular control over queries, allowing a certain percentage of queries to reach specific 
records. 
your individual weight / (sum of all the other weights) 

Exp:
1. Create two/three servers with apache configured
2. Create the weighted record set with  35,60,80 and show them the difference
3. Increase the weight for the least one & show the result.
Note: Keep ttl less for better results

N.Virginia Server ::
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from N.Virginia" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

Ohio Server :

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from Ohio" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd



4. Routing Policy: Latency
Takes the best available location servers so that it will serve faster to the end customer. It entirely depends
on the bandwidth of your ISP

N.Virginia Server ::

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from N.Virginia" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

Ohio Server :

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from Ohio" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

London Server : OR (Bahrain Server My Case :)

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from Bahrain" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

5. Routing Policy: GeoLocation
This helps in definig the network based on the location. If the records are created based on the region
if the hit comes from that particular region then it will pass other wise it will not return anything. This is the
reason you have to pass default as part of the router. 

Bahrain Server :

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from Bahrain" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

N.Virginia Server :

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am from N.Virginia" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd


Note: The nearest location will get resolved in this type of routing. 
Make sure you are NOT selecting sublocation under (US).

3. Types of Instances 
	reserved
	spot
	on demand
	dedicated
4. Explain about the Availability zones 
5. Start Creating Ec2 & explain in detail about every stage
	Type of instances (slide)
	https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
	Root Volume/disk details
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html
	Ebs Volume types 
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html
	Default Users:

Note: Explain about securitygroup

Once instance launched go through the USERDATA(BootStrap) Part & accidental termination options

6. what is EBS & use of EBS & volume-types

Create one volume & attach the volume to one server & other server too ...
Increase the size of the volume & show the increased size 
Example:
create two servers in 2 AZ's, create one EBS & show them the difference & drawback

7. EBS snapshots & importance of snapshot & moving disk across AZ's
explain about throughput & Iops

Throughput:
Amount of data can be process per second ie., it might be 30Mbps per GB
IOPS:
Its basically i/p & o/p per second. How many times the spindle can rotate for reading the data from the disk.

(New Topic)
8. Migrating EBS across regions

9. Explain about security group,inbound & outbound rules & importance of security group

Security groups are stateful: This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will be automatically 
applied to the outgoing rule. e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, the outgoing port 80 will be automatically opened.

10. Instance metadata

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

11. AMI & its usage 
explain about software installation for 100+ servers

(New Topic)
12. Moving AMI's across regions

Move it to Linux ::

13. Explain about the private interfaces & attaching new interfaces to the instance
similary tell them about the Eip (elastic ipaddress) allocation & deallocation 

14. Instance Roles
Explain about Aws Cli by configuring programatic access
Use the roles to list the s3 buckets

15. Console logs & explanation

Commands ::

commands to mount a new disk::

lsblk --> Lists all the disks
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf --> helps to format the disk
mkdir /myapp
mount -t ext4 /dev/xvdf /myapp
df -hT /myapp

commands to unmount a disk 

cd
umount /myapp

commands to mount and existing disk 

mkdir -p /myapp
mount -t ext4 /dev/xvdf /myapp

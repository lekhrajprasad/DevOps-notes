VPC ::

1. Explain about ipaddress & use of ipaddress & types of ip ranges (ipv4/6)

2. Explain about the ipv4 with diff classes & in detail ipaddress classification properly

	0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
	Class	1st Octet Decimal Range	1st Octet High Order Bits	Network/Host ID (N=Network, H=Host)	
	Default Subnet Mask	Number of Networks	Hosts per Network (Usable Addresses)

	A		1 – 126*	0	N.H.H.H	255.0.0.0	126 (27 – 2)	16,777,214 (224 – 2)
	B		128 – 191	10	N.N.H.H	255.255.0.0	16,382 (214 – 2)	65,534 (216 – 2)
	C		192 – 223	110	N.N.N.H	255.255.255.0	2,097,150 (221 – 2)	254 (28 – 2)
	D		224 – 239	1110	Reserved for Multicasting
	E		240 – 254	1111	Experimental; used for research

3. Teach them about the CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) blocks & how to get no of ipaddress.

	2^(32-subnet) = No.Of ips


4. Explain about the home internet & then inter relate with VPC 

5. Create one normal VPC with default subnet,routes,IGW,etc .. 

tell them about the magic of 5 ips in the subnet ex (10.0.0.0/24)
10.0.0.0: Network address.

10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.

10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for mapping to the Amazon-provided DNS.

10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.

10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address."

Explain about the usecase of bastion server

6. Add bit more complexity with private zone

7. Difference between NACL & Security Groups

diff b/w Security Group & NACL

SG are stateful sets,NACL are stateless 

	--> ACL's can work only on subnet ranges but not on individual resources like EC2
	--> ACL's can ALLOW/DENY the entire network range where you can't do with security group
	--> ACL's work at Layer 4
	--> In security group if you allow in bound then you no need to give outbound

8. Add bit more with vpc peering in the region 

9. Add bit more on VPC peering across the region

10. Explain in detail about the endpoints & use case of gateway endpoints 
Note: Explain them with s3 & ec2 server

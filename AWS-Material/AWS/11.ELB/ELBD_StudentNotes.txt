Elastic Load Balancer ::

Load balancing is an essential architecture to understand, as it allows systems to scale and tolerate individual 
instance failure

1. Explain in detail about the old infrastructure, teach them what will happen if server goes down
2. Teach them the use case of loadbalencers
3. Start the network fundamentals "Seven-Layer OSI Model"
In order to remember the layers you can keep it as "Please Do Not Throw Sausae Piza Away"
4. Start the different Loadbalencers in AWS
	Classic
	Application
	Network
	
5. Explain in detail about classic loadbalencer & draw backs in using it.

Create 2/3 servers with below userdata in each server 

server1:
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am server1" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

server2:
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am server2" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

server3:
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hi I am server3" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd

6. Explain in detail about the application loadbalencer and use case of having it 
	1. Create two servers cars & bikes
	
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Welcome To Cars page" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd
mkdir /var/www/html/cars/

#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Welcome To Bikes page" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart httpd
mkdir /var/www/html/bikes/

	2. Download the cars & bikes images to the respective servers

	Two Wheelers Bikes::
	wget -O /var/www/html/bikes/bike1 https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-640,height-480,imgsize-83658,resizemode-1,msid-72037164/suzuki-motor-wants-a-repeat-of-maruti-from-india-in-two-wheelers.jpg
	wget -O /var/www/html/bikes/bike2 https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-09/top-two-wheelers-to-buy-in-the-festive-season_827x510_41505137327.jpg

	Four Wheelers Cars::
	wget -O /var/www/html/cars/car1 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/11/Lam1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnAdySV0BR-4fDN_-_p756cVfcy8zLGPV4EhRkjQy7tg.jpg?imwidth=450
	wget -O /var/www/html/cars/car2 https://www.motoringresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01-fastest-cars.jpg


	3. Create target groups (cars & bikes)
	4.Configure the listeners accordingly & show them the ALB usecases

7. Explain in detail about the network loadbalencer & use of it .
